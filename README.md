# Bash-Nmap-Scanners
This is going to be a repository of all the bash nmap scanners that I make. I will take requests of what to add and will do my best to add more when I can!


I will also be adding a section of python scripts to my a repo soon... I just have to get some more bash scripts and write ups posted!

The next bash nmap script will most likely be one invulving the fingerprinting side of nmap.

Let me know of any ideas, comments or reccomendations!


any help in the scripts will be supplied with the 
-h
argument
